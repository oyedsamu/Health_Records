# Health Records
A National Health Directory project built by DecaDevs on Internship with Access Bank Plc.

This project will make it possible for Hospitals and other Heath centres in the country to easily collaborate in taking care of patients by having easy and secure access to patients' medical records. 

The benefits of this project includes:
- A National HealthCare database.
- Reduce unnecessary testing whenever a patient needs to be treated in a new health facility.
- Easy management of patients' information.
- Prevention of wrong medication as allergies and previous medical records are used before and during treatment.
